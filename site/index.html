                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    As I approach the end of my Computer Engineering journey at the University of Guelph, I am impassioned by the realms of DevOps, cloud technologies, AI, and software development.
                    With a track record of project leadership, both in professional settings and academic environments, I thrive in collaborative teams where my enthusiasm and curiosity align with my peers.
                    My comfort in dynamic environments is complemented by an eagerness to confront challenges that not only expand my knowledge but also sharpen my skills.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What sets me apart is my unwavering commitment to continuous learning. This dedication is underscored by my ability to swiftly acquire proficiency in new technologies, exemplified by my attainment of two AWS Certifications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of my notable accomplishments is the comprehensive redevelopment of a distributed monitoring stack. The initial architecture, though functional, required users to navigate disparate pages for debugging, leading to diminished visibility.
                    In the re-imagined design, depicted in the simplified diagram below, users can now seamlessly access metrics, logs, and traces for all projects from a unified interface.
                    <br><img src="imgs/old.png" alt="The Old Monitoring Architecture"><br>
                    Additionally, I integrated a BigQuery datasource for effortless visualization of billing data for GCP projects. The resultant single-pane observability empowers developers to expedite issue resolution and maintain heightened service visibility.

                <p>
                    Looking ahead, post-graduation, my aspirations extend to furthering my journey in a DevOps role, while remaining open to diverse and exciting opportunities.

                    This project demonstrates the deployment of a simple static website, containing some information about me!
                    Built with <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong> for simplicity and speed, the site is deployed on <strong>Google Cloud Platform (GCP)</strong> using <strong>Terraform</strong> for infrastructure automation and <strong>Cloud DNS</strong> for domain management. 
                    <strong>GitHub Actions</strong> automates the deployment workflow, enabling seamless updates to the website's content and infrastructure with every push to the repository.

                <p>
                    This project is still in progress. The next feature I intend to add is a visitor counter!
